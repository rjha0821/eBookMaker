# eBookMaker (using python)

What is this? 
This is a small project that demonstrates some of the features of tkinter, but  can also be  used to do something interesting. 
From the application you can create different txt files, edit the text, change their names, delete them,  the different files are listed on the right side of the application 
and you can also convert them to an html page with all the text of the application. 
different files or an html page with one page of text. It accepts plain text, to which you can add some symbols at the beginning of the line to make some markup,
or use html tags directly. I'm actually using it and  will add new features  in the future (eg push to Github repository when saving files)

Some features 
 I added some features to the application: 
      1. renaming files (by button or pressing F2) 
      2. deleting files 
      3. the ability to add 
      4. H2 tag  * 
      5. H3 tag  ^ 
      6. image tag # 
 So now it's almost  complete application, although it is very rough and needs redefined.
 
 A simple App to manage txt files that will be rendered in one of plus html files
